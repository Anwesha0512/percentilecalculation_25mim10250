1. Problem Statement - Students often receive marks or scores after an exam, but these raw numbers do not clearly show how they performed compared to the rest of the class. Percentile ranking gives a better picture by showing the percentage of students who scored lower than a particular student.
The problem is to create a program that collects marks from a group of students and calculates the percentile for any selected score.

2. Scope of the Project:
    The program focuses only on percentile calculation based on marks.
    It works for any number of students, as long as marks are provided by the user.
    It runs in a terminal/command-line environment and does not require external libraries.
    The project uses only core Python concepts such as lists, loops, and functions.
    The scope does not include grading, rank calculation, or report card generation.

3. Target Users
    Students who want to check their relative performance in class.
    Teachers who need a quick way to compare marks without manual calculation.
    Beginners in Python who want to practice basic data structures and functions.
    Educational institutions looking for a simple tool to demonstrate percentile concepts.

4. High-Level Features
     Accepts marks for multiple students and stores them in a list.
     Allows the user to choose the score for which the percentile is to be calculated.
     Counts how many students scored below the selected marks.
     Calculates percentile using a simple mathematical formula.
     Displays results in a clear, readable format.
     Handles incorrect or invalid inputs with basic error checks.
