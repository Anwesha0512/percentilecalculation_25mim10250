# percentilecalculation_25mim10250
This project is a basic python program made for calculating the percentile of a student based on the marks of a group of students 
1. Project Title - Percentile Calculation Program using Python
2. Overview of the Project - This project is a simple Python program that calculates the percentile of a student based on the marks of an entire class.
The user can enter marks for multiple students, and the program determines how many students scored below a particular student and then computes the percentile using a basic percentile formula.
The goal of the project is to practice working with lists, functions, loops, and simple calculations in Python. The program runs in the terminal and does not require any external libraries.
3. Features - Add marks for any number of students
              Store data in a Python list
              Select a student’s marks to calculate their percentile
              Automatically compute: total students, number of students scoring below , percentile value
              Simple menu-driven interface
              No external modules required
4. Technologies / Tools Used
  Programming Language: Python
  Tools: Any text editor (VS Code / Notepad++ / Sublime / IDLE)
         Command line / terminal to run the script
  Core Concepts Used:Lists , Functions , Loops , Basic arithmetic calculations
5. Steps to Install & Run the Project
    1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
    2. Download or clone the project folder.
    3. Open the folder in your editor (optional).
    4. Run the following command in terminal:  python main.py or python3 main.py
    5. Follow the instructions shown in the menu.
6. Instructions for Testing
    To test the program:
    1. Choose the option to add marks and enter at least 5–6 student scores.
    2. After adding the marks, select the option to calculate percentile.
    3. Enter the marks of the student whose percentile you want to calculate.
    4. Verify the output:
       Count how many students scored below that student
       Confirm the percentile using the formula:  (students scoring below / total students) × 100
    5. Try different marks to see how percentile changes.
    6. Test edge cases: Lowest score
                        Highest score
                        Duplicate scores
